# TimsIRCBot <br />
This is my own IRC bot programmed in C# with ChatSharp  <br />
# Getting started <br />
First off you need to download the latest release from the release section here: https://github.com/tim241/TimsIRCBot/releases <br />
After downloading the .zip file, you need to extract the file, I recommend using 7zip or the windows built-in one. <br />
When you extracted the zip file it will look something like this: <br />

<br />
Also the program creates an folder called TimsBot in your systemdrive. Like you can see in that folder are some folders and one program called TimsBot.exe. <br />
